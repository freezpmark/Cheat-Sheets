 - Decision Trees


My Project / Portfolio (Odoo, Travels):
 - Process all into one: AI Courses (Maths+ML+DL+NLP) + NNFS.IO Book + (ChatGBT video) + my Math sheets + BC thesis + ML Matfyz Course + SVM doc -> put them together into ipynb/docs -> think of how to include it into my Odoo website [graph from basic /*+- operators to AI math functions,, WHERE DO YOU USE LOG? DERIVATES? arg., but also parameters like lambda/learning rate, where applicable as different bubble in the graph or sth.]
