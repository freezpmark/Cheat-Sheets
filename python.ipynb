Once the data is received the coroutine resumes from the point it was suspended, performs processing (presumably based on the data it got), and possibly sends its results to another coroutine.

A solution to this is to use coroutines. We can implement each operation as a coroutine and then start them all off. If one is slow it won’t affect the others—at least not until they run out of data to process—since they all operate independently. (more in book)\n",
